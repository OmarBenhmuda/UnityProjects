For App 1, I completed the tutorial linked above. The tutorial consists of an angry birds clone:

The bird can be launched, and there are monsters that must be elimanted. The tutorial was very helpful
with teaching me how to use the Unity game engine and how to traverse through its many features. Additionally, the
tutorial focused a lot on the programming of the game using C#. 

In terms of what I had personally changed to the game to "make it my own", I added a feature where the player could click anywhere
on the game while the bird was airborn and the bird would get a boost of added force in the direction it was travelling in. This was
done by using a coroutine to track the previous position of the bird every 0.25 seconds. Then every update(), if the user clicks
the primary mouse button, a Vector2 direction is calculated using the birds current direction subtracted by its previous direction
from the coroutine. 

Additionally I made a small change where the player cannot mouseDrag or mouseDown on the Bird until it has been reset so that the player
cannot grab the bird while it has already been launched.
